python-openam - Python interface to OpenAM REST API

Code borrowed and reworked from django-opensso by nsb
https://github.com/nsb/django-opensso
https://github.com/jathanism/python-opensso

The openam.py module provided by django-openam had a dependency upon
python-restclient which in turn had a dependency upon python-httplib2. I removed
these dependencies in favor of Python's urllib2, which is part of the Standard
Library.  Since we're just doing basic HTTP GET calls, I felt that eliminating
the external dependencies made this library as lightweight as possible.

For REST API documentation please see:

This is not a complete implementation. Only the end-user functionality has
been included.  None of the administrative methods are implemented... yet.

Example:

>>> import openam
>>> oam = openam.OpenAM('https://example.com/openam')
>>> oam.authenticate('pepesmith', 'likesbananas')
>>> oam.is_token_valid()
True
>>> attrs = oam.attributes()
>>> attrs.attributes.keys()
['telephonenumber', 'distinguishedname', 'inetUserStatus', 'displayname', 'cn',
'dn', 'samaccountname', 'useraccountcontrol', 'objectguid', 'userprincipalname',
'name', 'objectclass', 'sun-fm-saml2-nameid-info', 'sn', 'mail',
'sun-fm-saml2-nameid-infokey', 'givenname', 'employeenumber']
>>> attrs.attributes.get('displayname')
'Smith, Pepe'
>>> oam.logout()
>>> oam.is_token_valid()
False
